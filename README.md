- Vectorized Eye Ray Generation
- Anti-Aliasing via eye ray jittering
- Phong Normal Interpolation for mesh structures
- Uniform Spherical Importance Sampling
- Cosine Importance Sampling
- Progressive Mante Carlo Estimation
- Direct Illumination
- Light Importance Sampling
- BRDF Importance Sampling 
- Implicit Ray Path Tracing with arbitrary number of bounces
